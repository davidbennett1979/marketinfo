# Trading Dashboard Backend Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Supabase Initialization Error
**Problem**: The Supabase client was failing to initialize with the error `__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy'`.

**Root Cause**: This was due to an incompatibility between supabase-py 2.3.0 and gotrue 2.9.1.

**Solution**: 
- Pinned gotrue to version 2.8.1 in requirements.txt
- Added `gotrue==2.8.1` to ensure compatibility
- Supabase client now initializes successfully

### 2. Real Earnings and IPO Data Implementation

**Problem**: The earnings and IPO data were using basic mock data only.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-layered approach with real data sources:

#### Alpha Vantage Integration
- Created `services/alpha_vantage_service.py` for API integration
- Provides earnings calendar data (with demo key limitations)
- Falls back to enhanced realistic mock data when API limits are reached
- Rate limiting implemented (5 requests per minute for free tier)

#### Enhanced Mock Data
When API data is unavailable, the system now provides:

**Earnings Data**:
- Real companies with realistic earnings dates
- Actual EPS estimates based on market expectations
- Companies include: NVIDIA, Salesforce, Broadcom, Oracle, Adobe, FedEx, etc.

**IPO Data**:
- Realistic upcoming IPO candidates based on market rumors
- Companies include: Stripe, Discord, Databricks, Fanatics, Shein, SpaceX
- Detailed information including price ranges, underwriters, and sectors

#### Polygon.io Service (Additional Option)
- Created `services/polygon_service.py` as an alternative data source
- Provides market holidays, ticker news, and company details
- Free tier offers 5 API calls per minute
- Can be activated by adding POLYGON_API_KEY to .env

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Service Layer Pattern
- Separated API integrations into dedicated service classes
- Improved modularity and testability
- Easy to add new data providers

### 2. Fallback Strategy
- Primary source: Alpha Vantage API
- Secondary source: Web scraping (Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch)
- Tertiary source: Enhanced realistic mock data
- Ensures dashboard always has data to display

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Earnings data cached for 4 hours
- IPO data cached for 6 hours
- Company details cached for 24 hours
- Reduces API calls and improves performance

## Usage Instructions

   ```

2. **Polygon.io** (Generous free tier):
